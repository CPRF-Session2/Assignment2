1.   a) 5 is equal or less than 4 - false
	5 does not equal 9 - true
	5 is larger than 10 - false
	false || false == FALSE

     b) 5 is larger than 0 - true
	5 is smaller than 10 - true
	5 does not equal 6 - true
	true && true && true == TRUE

     c) 5 equals 1 - false
	5 is larger than 0 - true
	false || true == TRUE

2. Yes, because strings can be stored in a variable and that data type can be used in a case.

3. There needs to be an adress operator because scanf() requires a pointer. It will give a warning when compiled, and if you still execute the code, there will be a runtime error which dumps the core.
