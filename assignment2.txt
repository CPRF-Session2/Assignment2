1. What is the outcome of the following conditional statements if the value of variable x is 5? Show your work.
	a. 5 <= 4 is false
	   (x != 9 && x > 10) is false because x>10 is false
	   Therefore, the conditional statement is false 

	b. x > 0 is true
	   x < 10 is true
	   x != 6 is true
	   Therfore, the conditional statement is true

	c. x == 1 is false
	   x > 0 is true
	   Therefore, the conditional statement is true

2. Can we use string value/variable in switch test condition? Why or why not?
  Yes, since the switch expressions can be character strings. 


3. What is twrong with the code snippet? As written, what will it do?
   You need a "&" symbol before userIn since it is a scanf. As written, it won't do anything since the computer won't be able to find memory address where the   variable is stored.
