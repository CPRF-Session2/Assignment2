Rebecca Hale Assignment 2 Part 2
1.
a.false or (true and false) = false
b.true and true and true = true
c.false or true = true

2. I do not believe that a string value/variable can be used in a switch
condition because there is no way to represent a string of letters or characters in C, therefore there is no way to compare two variables in one switch.

3. The code is missing the & symbol before the userIn statement in the 
scanf() function.  This code will result in an error, specifically a 
segmentation fault.
