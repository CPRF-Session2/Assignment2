a
5 is less than or equal to 4(false)
5 is not equal to 9(true)
5 is not greather than 10 (false)
The first part is false, and the second part is false since evem though one of the statments is true, it uses the &&. And since one statement is false, the second part is false. This means the whole code is false since false or false is false.

b.
5 is greather than 0 (true)
5 is less than 10 (true)
5 does not equal 6 (true)
Since && is used and all the statments are true, the entire code is true.

c.
5 equals 1(false)
5 is greather than 0 (true)
Since  || is used, only one statement needs to be true to make the entire 
code true. And since one statement is true, the entire code is true.

2.
We can not use string/variable in switch test condition. We can because we
can't assign a variable equal to a string.

The following code snippet does not have &. This does not give the input a  memory address. This code will take the user input, but it won't store the 
input value. This means this variable won't be able to be accessed. This 
code could also give the user an error.
