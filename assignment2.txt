 What is the outcome of the following conditional statements if the value of variable x is 5? Show your work.

a. x <= 4 || (x != 9 && x > 10)
   false(0) || (true (1) && false (0))
   false (0)|| false (0)
   the outcome is false

b. x > 0 && x < 10 && x != 6
   true (1) && true (1) && true (1)
   final outcome is true (1)

c. x == 1 || x > 0
   false (0) || true (1)
   final outcome is true (1)
   
Can we use string value/variable in switch test condition? Why or why not?
Yes, the value of the variable could be a string, and if the cases string matched the string attached to the variable, then the statements  would be carried out. For example, if the variable was; string name= "Madeleine" and there were cases; case "Olivia", case "Emma" and case "Madeleine", the statements for case "Madeleine" would be executed.  

What is wrong with the following code snippet? As written, what will it do?
	int userIn;
	scanf(“%d”, userIn);
This code is wrong because there is no "&" infront of "userIn" so it will produce a runtime error.
